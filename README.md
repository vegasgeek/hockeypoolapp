# Hockey Pool App plugin

This is the main WordPress plugin that manages the new version of hockeypoolapp.com (launching in 2023 season). This plugin requires the following:

- A WordPress install (duh)
- Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin
- The following Custom Post Types: `picks`, `playoffs`, and `teams`

## things I've yet to do
Prior to launching this on [hockeypool.app](https://hockeypool.app), I need to manually migrate the data from the current site into the new database format. Once that's completed, this new version can launch and then historical data can be preserved moving forward.

## Suggestions welcome
This plugin is a labor of love. I built it because I love building admin tools.

That said, I'm sure there are features missing, better ways of handling things, etc. With that in mind, please feel free to drop suggestions as issues on this repo and they'll definitely be considered.
